If you're an engineer, I'm pretty sure you've taken part in at least one hackathon in your college days. And chances are high that winning one is/was also in your college bucket list. Well, at least it was for me. And I did it... finally. At long last.

So, this event took place from 17th Feb, 2021. I was in my final undegrad year. I had been a regular hackathoner by this time, with a fair share of heartbreaks in my early days. By this time, the results didn't matter much, or not at all for that matter. It was about building something useful or discovering something fascinating. The idea is to come up with something that adds value. Hackathons are a great way to learn and explore a plethora of stuff.

Ok let's cut to the chase! I signed up individually for this event. Luckily my profile was shortlisted and I was paired alonsgide 3 other solo participants from India, coincidentally. Coincidentally, ours was also the only team that was created by the organizers. All the other teams were representing their college, including, Queens, Columbia, etc. I guess Indians don't really trust their friends.

My team comprised of Himanshu Bajpai (from BITS, Pilani), Aanisha Bhattacharya (from IEM, Kolkata), Foridur Rahman (from Pune University) and of course, yours truly. We connected instantly, over WhatsApp, and the first thing we did was to come up with "Abraca-Data", the name for our team. Not too bad, eh?

Let's talk about the hackathon now. It consisted of 3 challenges.

1. Challenge 1 – Covid-19 Open Challenge
2. Challenge 2 – Refugee Crisis: Predict Forced Displacement
3. Challenge 3 – UN75 Visualisation Challenge

We went with the 1st challenge. All of us recognized the sense of immediacy in this track and felt that research on Covid can help us come up with insights and inferences that we are not yet familiar with.

In the end, we came up with a new outlook on the pandemic and how we could help fight this and similar pandemics in the imminent future. Our research was liked by the eminent jury panel that consisted of members from UNICC and other United Nations organizations, and we were subsequently awarded with the 1st place in the Covid-19 Open Challenge Track.
